Android-Authenticity-Prediction
Problem Definition and Approach-
Android malware is the malicious program that damages our application or even the entire system. It can also corrupt the data or can leak the sensitive information of the user. The main objective of this project is to classify an app as benign or malware based on the datasets we have. This is a type of binary classification problem so we can use various  classification algorithms such as logistic regression, svm, knn, decison trees or other ensemble techniques. As the initial approach to the proble i have explored the data and come up with the features which are to be taken care in feature engineering after I have used Logistic Regression as the baseline model and later on used Random Forest, Gradient Boosting . For evaluation of classification algorithms, metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision,sensitivity,specificity, f1-score and AUC - ROC cruve have been used.
